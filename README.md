# Contest Library
A Java general-purpose and algorithm library initially made for use in coding competition submissions, but by now I've started including it in some projects too.

Most of the code has been written for personal use only, large parts of it during a coding competition (in a "I need this let's add this" fashion), so it's neither commented nor documented.

Mostly on GitHub for reference purposes. Has no real advantages over its competitors (eg. Guava, Apache Commons etc.); better use theirs.
