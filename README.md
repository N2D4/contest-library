# Contest Library
A Java general-purpose and algorithm library initially made for use in coding competition submissions, but by now I've started including it in some projects too.

Most of the code has been written for personal use only, large parts of it during a coding competition (in a "I need this let's add this" fashion). Some parts may be documented and unit tested, others may not. Use at your own risk.
